# Stick-War-Revamped-2
*Many of the empires you previously controlled are now rebels that have fled to the outskirts of their homelands. You are faced with the threat of attack. Speartons have rebuilt and declared war against your diminished army. What will you do..?*

Play a **RTS** game, control your army, and defeat the Chaos Empire... Are you strong enough to do so?

This is a mod of the ogirinal game "Stick War 2" that got made in about 2012, we have done som changes and added some mini-bosses to up the games difficulty, as the old version hasn't been updated for 6-7 years! We took it upon ourselfves to import all the changed from Stick Empires into Stick War 2 and we have done some bug fixes and added some new features.
